As part of my UI/UX design portfolio, I created a responsive website design for a futuristic AI-themed concept titled COSMIC. This project focused on delivering a fluid, adaptable interface that provides an optimized experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

Responsive Design Focus
1. Device-Agnostic Layout
I ensured that the layout is fully responsive, meaning all design components seamlessly adjust to various screen sizes. Whether viewed on a desktop or a mobile phone, the layout maintains clarity, hierarchy, and impact.

2. Adaptive Hero Section
On desktop, the hero section spans wide, with the headline “DISCOVER AI'S POTENTIAL” placed strategically over a cinematic AI-themed background for immersive storytelling.

On mobile, the hero section is vertically stacked, and the content is centered to prioritize readability and visual balance. The background image is cropped intelligently to retain its visual essence without overwhelming the content.

3. Typography Scaling
The heading and body text automatically scale to remain readable and visually consistent on smaller screens. I maintained a bold typographic style without compromising legibility.

4. Mobile Navigation Optimization
On desktop, I used a traditional top navigation bar with visible links (Home, Navigation, About, Work, Contact).

On mobile, this was replaced with a hamburger menu icon to conserve space while still offering easy access to navigation options.

5. Touch-Friendly Interactions
The “GET STARTED” call-to-action button is designed to be large and clearly visible on both desktop and mobile. On mobile, it's placed with ample padding for easy thumb interaction.

6. Flexible Grid & Alignment
All sections (headings, paragraphs, images, CTAs) use flexbox/grid systems to remain responsive. I applied consistent margins, padding, and alignment adjustments using media queries to maintain visual integrity across breakpoints.
